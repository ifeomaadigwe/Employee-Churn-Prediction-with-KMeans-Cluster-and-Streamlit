Sure, Phyniks! Here's a professional, comprehensive `README.md` tailored to your **Employee Churn Prediction** project — reflecting all the components you’ve described:

# 💼 Employee Churn Prediction

A machine learning pipeline designed to identify patterns in employee behavior and predict potential churn using unsupervised clustering. Built with automation, interactive visualization, and deployable tooling in mind.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

**Problem Statement:**  
Employee churn presents a significant cost to businesses — both in lost talent and institutional knowledge. The goal of this project is to identify clusters of employees based on behavioral, performance, and engagement data to:

- Proactively detect groups at risk of leaving
- Recommend actionable strategies for HR or management
- Improve retention planning using data-driven insights

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach

This project takes a modular and reproducible approach by:

- Automating data ingestion and preprocessing
- Applying KMeans clustering (k=6) to uncover natural employee groupings
- Visualizing and interpreting these clusters for actionable decision-making

## 🔧 Pipeline Workflow

1. **Data Loading:**  
   Loads cleaned employee dataset (`hr_data_cleaned.csv`), containing key features such as satisfaction, evaluation scores, project load, tenure, department, and salary level.

2. **Automated Cleaning (preprocessing.py):**  
   - Scales numerical variables  
   - Encodes categorical variables (e.g., Salary, Department) using `OneHotEncoder`  
   - Wraps the transformation pipeline using `ColumnTransformer`

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (eda.py):**  
   Visualizes distributions, correlations, and behavior patterns. Aids in identifying features most linked to churn risk.

4. **Optimal Clustering Selection (silhouette.py):**  
   Calculates silhouette scores for `k=2` through `k=10`, recommending **k=6** based on peak cohesion and separation.  

   ![Silhouette Score Plot](artifacts/silhouette_scores.png) ← *(Add manually if applicable)*

5. **Model Training (train_model.py):**  
   Trains a `KMeans(n_clusters=6)` model on preprocessed features. Stores model artifacts for reuse in the web app.

## 🎯 Clustering Results (k = 6)

| Cluster | Insight                                                         | Recommendation                      |
|--------:|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 0       | High performers — happy and productive                          | Retain and develop for leadership    |
| 1       | Stable but underperforming                                      | Realign role or offer mentorship     |
| 2       | Disengaged and low productivity                                 | Investigate dissatisfaction ASAP     |
| 3       | Inconsistent or emerging patterns                               | Provide coaching, feedback, or review|
| 4       | Solid contributors, steady morale                               | Encourage further growth             |
| 5       | Critical churn risk — low satisfaction, low evaluation          | Immediate intervention required      |

Clusters were validated visually and numerically using PCA-reduced plots and descriptive stats.

## 💻 Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit)

Launches an intuitive web interface to:

- Input individual employee profiles
- Predict cluster membership in real-time
- Get plain-English cluster interpretations and recommended HR actions
- Visualize satisfaction, project count, and workload dynamically

**Preview:**

---

## 🐳 Docker Support

Easily deploy the app in a containerized environment:

```bash
docker build -t churn-predictor .
docker run -p 8501:8501 churn-predictor
```

Then navigate to: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

---

## 📘 Swagger UI (API Blueprint)

A Swagger YAML file (`docs/swagger.yaml`) is included for defining RESTful endpoints — paving the way for exposing the model as a service via FastAPI or Flask.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9+**
- **scikit-learn** — modeling & preprocessing
- **Pandas / NumPy** — data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly** — visualization
- **Streamlit** — interactive web app
- **Docker** — containerization
- **Swagger UI** — API documentation

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Integrate FastAPI + Swagger for API-based predictions
- Connect to a live database for dynamic employee records
- Integrate churn likelihood scoring using supervised ML
- Enable batch uploads and department-level insights
